# Dan's kata tests

This is a solution which I use to hold the various projects that I attempt from TDD Katas found online.

It is intended to include only my first attempt at each kata.

The Roman numerals kata is an excellent example of how TDD code can end up entirely different (and more concise) than it would have been if it had not been written iteratively. **As the tests get more specific, the code becomes more generic.**

Feedback is welcome (as long as it is not about the amount of coffee that I make for my co-workers).
